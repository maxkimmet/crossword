# A crossword site for my crossword friends

This repository contains the code for a multiplayer crossword website and the algorithm used to generate the crosswords. A link to the website can be found in the project's **About** section on GitHub.

I started doing crosswords with a few of my friends near the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but struggled to find a website that allowed all of us to play together. This website is designed with the following features in mind:

- Multiplayer without sign-up
- Multiplayer with unlimited players
- American style, densely packed 15x15 crosswords where all letters are part of both a horizontal and vertical clue
- Mobile support

This project is also an excuse for me to learn .NET Core and React. The crossword generator is written in Python.
